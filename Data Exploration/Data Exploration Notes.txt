Points definitely seems like a good indicator
I'm going to defer on using this since it's collinear with many other variables
It's too general of a statistic

Interestingly, first serve percentage is about the same distribution between winners and losers

Higher distribution in first serve %, 2nd serve won, retFstWon/retSndWon for winners compared to losers***

aces about the same, slightly higher for winners, same with DF

strangely about the same for winners

winners have less UE compared to losers***

WUeratio slight difference

losers will face more break points compared to winners ***

Winners will save more break points ***

based on the shape, winners will save more break points
shows a lot did not save, but it may be that they did not face any at all, will have to fix that**

generally winners will will win more break points *

net points pct won, higher for winners

forced about the same

unret is about the same
